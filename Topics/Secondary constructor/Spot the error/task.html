<h2>Spot the error</h2>
<p>Being able to spot errors in code is a very useful skill. Can you identify the mistake made in the code below?</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Employee {
    val name: String
    val salary: Int

    constructor(name: String, salary: Int) {
        name = name
        salary = salary
    }
}</code></pre>
