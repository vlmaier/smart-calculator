<h2>Power and scopes</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>You have a program that prints the variable <code class="java">thirteen</code> equal to 13 raised to the power of 2 to 10. There is a loop that raises the number 13 to a power at each iteration. Now the program prints only the result of exponentiation to the 2nd power.</p>
<p>Change the code below so that it prints the correct result (9 numbers, each on a new line).</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You need to change the scope of the variable <code class="java">thirteen</code> by moving one line of code.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
